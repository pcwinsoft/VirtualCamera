Virtual Camera (WDM Video Capture Driver)

This code is for a WDM Video Capture, same as used by webcam manufacturers, except this one is virtual.

I developed from a sample of Windows DDK into a high resolution capable of near 16 different resolutions
and it is stable. At one point in time this code was used by Target in the U.S.A. and it was installed
on over 10000 PCs, so it is highly reliable.

With this coe you can build a virtual camera driver thst will be compatible with YouTube. Google Meet, 
Skype, and all other Apps and websites that support webcams.

Enjoy.
